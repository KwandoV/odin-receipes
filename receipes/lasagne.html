        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe is adapted from the official lasagne by the 
        Bolognese Chamber of Commerce, with a few tweaks inspired by
        locals—adjusting the meat, wine, and whether to add milk.
        One non-negotiable: Green lasagne sheets are essential.
        The ragù is simple, with no garlic, herbs, or spices. 
        Fresh pasta eliminates the need for pre-boiling.</p>
